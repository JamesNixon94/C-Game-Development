# C++ Game Development

Here is where I will store all of my game development which will be coded in C++ to prepare me for making indie style games

My first code uploaded is of a short game which uses basic C++ syntax to get a user to "crack security codes" into server rooms, the game has 10 levels which gradually get harder. the game is called TripleX. The "codes" are basic maths problems where the user must enter 3 numbers that add and multiply together to the two randomised numbers given.


My second game is the bull cows game this time using Unreal Engine 4 and C++. The idea of the game is to guess the word correctly that doesnt have any repeating letters (Isogram), removing lives of incorrect guesses.
